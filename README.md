# ❤️ web, software and game development

Hi, I'm Sandro. I love to design user interfaces, write software and build websites. Some of my projects include the [NET Watchdog](https://github.com/vortexdatanet/net-watchdog), [Teamspeak Query Plugin Framework](https://github.com/teamspeak-query-plugin-framework) and the [VortexdataNET website](https://vortexdata.net).

I also love to work on games using the Unreal Engine, which I've started using in 2015.
